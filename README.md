# Shape Detection Project

## Structure
- dataset/: Contains code and data for generating and storing the dataset.
- model/: Contains code and model file for training and saving the model.
- utils/: Contains utility functions for shape generation, model creation, curve handling, etc.
- scripts/: Contains scripts to run shape detection, plot results, and evaluation.

## Steps to Run
1. Generate the dataset:
   bash
   python dataset/generate_dataset.py
   

2. Train the model:
   bash
   python model/train_model.py
   

3. Run shape detection:
   bash
   python scripts/run_detection.py
   

4. Plot the shapes:
   bash
   python scripts/plot_shapes.py
